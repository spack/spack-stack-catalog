# Spack environment specification for code needed to run ExaCLAMR on non-CUDA systems.
# Notes:
# 1. A patch is needed to the cabana spack spec to get it to build with GPU support. 
#    That patch is in etc/
# 2. Set the cuda arch= flag in the kokkos like to the to the one appropriate one for your 
#    system
# 3. If you don't have CUDA, simply remove the cuda flags from the relevant lines
