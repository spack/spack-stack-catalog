# Spack environment specification for creating a container for building and
# testing the poisson benchmark without CUDA. In general we want to let 
# spack figure out the right version and options for hypre and MPI so we don't 
# specify them here. We do, however, specify to use gcc since we're going to 
# be installing that into the container in which the tests will run.

  specs:
  - git       # Need a newer version of git to be able to get submodules
  - cmake     # Make sure we get a new enough version of cmake
  - hdf5+mpi  # Silo should have an mpi-aware version of hdf5
  - silo@4.11 # Specify a non-bsd versions since some of those don't build
  - hypre-cmake +mpi # Make sure we get an mpi version of hypre
