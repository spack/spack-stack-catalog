  # Note that many Snakemake repositories require snakemake@7.5:
  # E.g., https://github.com/friendsofstrandseq/mosaicatcher-pipeline/
  - snakemake@7.18.2+s3+http+ftp+reports
  # Many users use the bioconda package for Snakemake.
  # However, the bioconda package for Snakemake pulls in several dependencies that are not true dependencies of Snakemake.
  # To be compatible with users who assume bioconda Snakemake, I must also pull in those packages.

  # Unfortunately, most of these do not exist in Spack.
