            A spack <a href="https://spack-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial_stacks.html" target="_blank">stack</a> can be thought of as a packaged set of packages to install alongside a configuration. They are typically represented in a file called `spack.yaml`. Thus, with the magic
            of the GitHub API, we can look for these configuration files across GitHub and present a set to you here. This is the spack stack catalog. How are spack.yaml files and repositories tagged for inclusion? The catalog includes stacks based on the following criteria:
          <ul>
                <li>The stack is contained in a public <a href="https://github.com/spack/spack-stack-catalog" target="_blank">Github</a> repository.</li>
                <li>The repository has one or more spack.yaml files.</li>
            </li>
                <li>The repository is small enough to be cloned into a Github actions job.</li>
                <li>The repository is not blacklisted <a target="_blank"
                href="https://github.com/spack/spack-stack-catalog/blob/main/skips.txt">here</a>.</li>
              </ul>
